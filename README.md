# Fake-Product-Review-Detection-And-Elimination-using-Opinion-Mining
This model is developed using Na√Øve Bayes,support vector machine(SVM), TF-IDF vectorizer methods. By applying these models one can know the number of fake reviews for a product or application instantly. 
To counter such spammers, a sophisticated model is required in which a need to be trained on millions of reviews.
In this work we did Fake Review detection on 20 Chicago Hotel Review Dataset using various supervised Machine Learning Techniques and classify the review whether it is fake or real.
